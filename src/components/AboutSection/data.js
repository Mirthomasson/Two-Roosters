    description: 'There is nothing more Appalachian than the smell of freshly popped kettle corn. Two Roosters was proudly started with roots deep in southern cuisine, and the desire to continue that age-old tradition. With over a decade spent in the throes of the culinary world, Two Roosters was started to leave the coop of the restaurant behind and focus on simple and delicious treats. Seeking out the highest quality of each ingredient with a concentration on NonGMO, Two Roosters is able to redefine a country fair favorite. After getting the corn business popping, Two Roosters also saw a need in the local market for the highest quality organic and small batch roasted coffee. Being a microroaster, every coffee bean is important and roasted to perfection — the Two Roosters way. Two Roosters is proud to be a part of the South Western Virginia community serving up the best damn NonGMO kettle corn and freshly roasted coffee!',
